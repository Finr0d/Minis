# Mini projects

This is a collection of mini-projects. 

None of them are intended to be particularly useful, mostly just random programming challenges. Those that do have any use-case are listed below, and any that are genuinly useful will be moved to a seperate repository.

The main purpose for this is to provide code samples, a place to store work and test new ideas, and provide any mini project I work on with proper source control.
