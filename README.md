# Mini projects

This is a collection of mini-projects. 

None of them are intended to be *particularly* useful, mostly just random programming challenges. Those that do have any use-case are listed below, and any that are genuinly useful will be moved to a seperate repository entirely.

The main purpose for this is to provide code samples, a place to store work and test new ideas, and provide any mini project I work on with proper source control.  

## badmake

*badmake* is a shell script that will build a C++ executable from a directory of files

## Licensing

This project uses the [Unlicense](UNLICENSE.txt) so that anyone can freely use any code in this repository for whatever they want. As mentioned earlier, I highly doubt a viable use-case will exist for these projects, as such this license will be sufficient.
